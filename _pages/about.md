<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a 1st-year Master student of [AIM Lab](http://aim-nercms.whu.edu.cn/) at [National Engineering Research Center for Multimedia Software (国家多媒体软件工程技术研究中心)](http://multimedia.whu.edu.cn/), [Wuhan University (武汉大学)](https://www.whu.edu.cn/), extremely fortunate to be supervised by [Prof. Zheng Wang](https://wangzwhu.github.io/home/). I received my Bachelor's degree from [School of Computer Science (计算机学院)](https://cs.whu.edu.cn/), [Wuhan University (武汉大学)](https://www.whu.edu.cn/).

My research interest focuses on multi-model retrieval and computer vision. If you are seeking any form of academic cooperation on multi-model retrieval and RAG, please feel free to email at [tianlikai@whu.edu.cn](tianlikai@whu.edu.cn).

<!-- My research interest includes neural machine translation and computer vision. I have published more than 100 papers at the top international AI conferences with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>260000+</span></strong></a> (You can also use google scholar badge <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>). -->

[Expressiveness is Effectiveness: Self-supervised Fashion-aware CLIP for Video-to-Shop Retrieval](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2016/papers/He_Deep_Residual_Learning_CVPR_2016_paper.pdf)

**Likai Tian**, Zhengwei Yang, Zechao Hu, Li Hao, Yifang Yin, Zheng Wang

- This work highlights the significance of salient frames in the Video-to-Shop Retrieval task and introduce fashion expressiveness to determine the saliency of each video frame.
- This work proposes a Self-supervised Fashion-aware Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (SF-CLIP) framework, which expands the ability of CLIP with a strong sense of fashion expressiveness for effective retrieval.
